# SpaceWanderer
Game I made for CSE 471 in Unity where player collects orbs in a dynamic environment


### Background:

I really enjoy space/sci-fi, so that was the theme of this game. I also enjoy the Gravity Falls theme song, although, admittedly, I have never watched the show. I thought it paired well with the space theme as well as the ominous vibe I was going for. I used a picture of one of my paintings for the backdrop and grabbed the font and the rest of the images from royalty free cites. 

In addition, I developed scripts in order to achieve certain affects. Various prompts should appear in text depending on the context. These are all quotes from the theme song.

### Game Play:

Player starts at top of scene and collects orbs incrementing its score as it descends down to platform. When the camera moves down, the player cannot move back up until it hits the bottom and vice versa.

When it reaches the bottom, platforms should appear and the orbs above should be regenerated. The player then begins the ascend back to the top. The game ends if it falls downward from the camera view. Player finishes the game when there are no more blue orbs left. 

Goal is to get all 10 points.
